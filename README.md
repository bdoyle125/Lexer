# Lexer

This is an assignment that I was assigned in my programming langauges class.

The symbols that are supported through this lexical analyzer are: "if", "for", "while", "function", "return", "int", "else", "do", "break", "end", "=", "+", "-", "*", "/", "%", ">", "<", ">=", "<=", "++", "(", ")", "{", "}", "|", "&", "==", "!", ",", and ";".

However, I have not implemented a way to ignore comments (designated with // or /* ... */
